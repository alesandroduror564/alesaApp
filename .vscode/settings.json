Okay, I need to optimize the given VSCode settings. Let me look through each setting carefully.

Starting with "editor.defaultFormatter": It's set to "esbenp.prettier-vscode". I know that Prettier is a popular formatter, but sometimes it's better to use a specific version. Maybe changing it to "prettier" could make it more straightforward.

Next, "editor.tabSize": 2. That seems fine; keeping tabs at two spaces is common and doesn't need optimization.

Looking at "files.associations": It's correctly associating EJS files in the app directory. No changes needed here.

"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true is good practice, so no issue there.

For "gitlens.advanced.blame.customArguments", the current setup ignores certain revisions via a file. That seems correct as is.

The JavaScript import preference for relative paths is standard, so no change needed there.

In the JSON schemas section, I notice that one schema uses an external URL from json.schemastore.org. It might be better to host this locally for consistency and reliability. So I'll update that URL to point to a local file instead of an external resource.

Lastly, the TypeScript SDK path looks correct as it points to the node_modules directory where TypeScript is installed locally.

Putting it all together, I'll adjust the formatter and move the schema URL internally.
</think>

{
  \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"prettier\",
  \"editor.tabSize\": 2,
  \"files.trimTrailingWhitespace\": true,
  \"javascript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier\": \"relative\",
  \"typescript.tsdk\": \"node_modules/typescript/lib\",
  \"gitlens.advanced.blame.customArguments\": [\"--ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs\"],
  \"files.associations\": {\"app/*.html\": \"ejs\"},
  \"json.schemas\": [
    {\"fileMatch\":\"app/manifest/*/*.json\",\"url\":\"./chrome-manifest.schema.json\"},
    {\"fileMatch\":\"package.json\",\"url\":\"./package.json.schema.json\",\"exclude\":{\"includeTypeScriptDetailsIfAvailable\":\"false\",}}]
}
