 We are simply exporting the default from './unlock-page.container'
 Since we are only re-exporting, we can do it in one line.
 However, note that the current code is already minimal and optimized.
 But if we want to make it even shorter, we can combine the import and export.

 However, the requirement says to optimize. The current code is two lines.

 We can do:

 export { default } from './unlock-page.container';

 This is a single line and avoids creating a local identifier.

 Alternatively, we could also use:

 export { default as UnlockPage } from './unlock-page.container';
 but then when importing this module as `import UnlockPage from ...` it would break because that expects a default export.

 Actually, the original code exports a default. So we need to maintain that.

 The best one-line equivalent for exporting the same thing (the default of unlock-page.container as our default) is:

 export { default } from './unlock-page.container';

 Let's check:
 Original: 
   import UnlockPage from ...; 
   export default UnlockPage;

 This exports whatever was imported as 'default' under the name 'UnlockPage' and then exports it again as our module's 'default'.

 With `export {default} from ...`, it directly re-exports the 'default' of unlock-page.container as our module's 'default'.

 Therefore, they are equivalent.

 Also note: there is no need for an extra line if we do this in one statement.

 So let's output:

```
export { default } from './unlock-page.container';
```

But wait! What if there are other named exports? That doesn't matter because in both cases we are only concerned with the default.

 However, note: The original does not have any named exports. So this change is safe and more efficient because no intermediate variable is created?

 Actually both will be handled by bundlers similarly. But using `export {...} from` avoids creating an intermediate binding which might be slightly better (especially for tree-shaking?).

 Conclusion: Replace with direct re-export.

export { default } from './unlock-page.container';
